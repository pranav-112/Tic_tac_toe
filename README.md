# Tic_tac_toe
First step in development. Fun game to play and easy to develop
the simple game of tic-tac-toe does following: 
> shows empty board and asks for user input coordinates for player X
> shows board with input and asks for user input coordinates for player O
> checks if one of the both players won or if the match is drawn for each iteration
> if yes, same msg will get printed
> if no, continue with taking the resopnse.
This is how the basic algorithm of game works.
